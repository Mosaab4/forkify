2. the app built with MVC structure
3. all recipes grabed from Food2Fork api using ajax calls
4. user can search recipes, like certain recipe, view the liked recipes (stored in browser's local storage) and can view the ingredients of each recipe also increase the ingredients for certain amount of people.
